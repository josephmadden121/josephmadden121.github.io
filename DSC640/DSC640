	  In this project, my goal was to deliver a comprehensive analysis of aviation safety metrics using a visually engaging dashboard. 

  To enhance the depth of my findings, I incorporated a supplemental dataset that provided additional insights into the aviation industry.

	  I followed a design methodology focusing on clarity, emphasizing color contrasts, and choosing appropriate chart types. 

  The bar chart and line chart effectively showcase trends, while the scatter plot reveals correlation between fatal accidents and fatalities.  

  The pie chart and heat map provide a succinct overview of incidents, and the packed bubble chart offers a comparative view. 

	  My presentation strategy involves starting with an overview, followed by a deep dive into fatalities, accidents, and incidents. 

  I then present airline-specific insights and conclude with recommendations for safety improvement. 

	  Ethical considerations were paramount in presenting to the executive committee. I ensured transparency in data sources, accuracy in visualizations, 

  and a balanced portrayal of each airlineâ€™s safety performance. 

  The objective is to empower decision-makers with actionable insights while maintaining ethical standards.
