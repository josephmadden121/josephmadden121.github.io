Description
1.	Pokemon Data Project (DSC530)
The goal of this data analysis project is to explore and understand containing statistics on 800 Pokemon cards and creating various visualizations. several insights can be derived:
2.	Apple Stock information (DSC540)
In this project, I worked on cleansing and transforming three datasets: “AAPL.csv”, “apple_stock_data.csv”, and “sales_record.csv”. These datasets contained information on Apple’s stock prices, sales records, and other related data. The primary goal was to merge these cleaned datasets into a single dataset in a SQLite database and then create five visualizations to demonstrate all the data.
3.	Loan Default Prediction Project (DSC550)
The significance of solving the loan default prediction problem cannot be overstated. By leveraging historical data and advanced machine learning techniques, lenders can enhance their risk assessment capabilities, resulting in several crucial benefits.
4.	Analyzing Customer Churn in the Telecommunication Industry (DSC630) 
This was a group project consisting of Shu Liu and Joseph Madden. 
5.	Investigating the impact of playing surfaces, specifically artificial turf, and natural grass, on injury rates in the NFL, with a focus on the occurrence of rupture Achilles injuries. This is the topic for my first project for this class. (DSC680)
6.	DSC640 – It’s an ongoing project.
I’m on week 4 for this class, so far, we haven’t had any coding related milestone projects. As I finish any projects for this class, then I will add it to my list of projects.  
7.	DSC680 – It’s an ongoing project.
I haven’t done the second project yet; this is week 4 which is when the first project is due. Week 8 is when I’ll finish the second project and I’ll add it to my list of projects.
8.	DSC680 – It’s an ongoing project.
I haven’t done the third project yet; this is week 4 which is when the first project is due. Week 12 is when I’ll finish the third project and I’ll add it to my list of projects.

Brief Description of project

The National Football League (NFL) faces an ongoing concern about players safety, specifically related to injuries sustained on different playing surfaces. This research aims to investigate the impact of artificial turf versus natural grass on injury rates, with a focus on the occurrence of ruptured Achilles injuries. The objective is to provide evidence-based insights to inform decisions related to field selection and improve player safety.
